# CHAOS FORGE – MANDELBROT TRAINING SIMULATOR
Link your deployed GitHub Pages canvas here or use the interactive version.

## Daily Drills (10–30 min)
1. Default view – observe infinite coastline  
2. Zoom to seahorse valley → notice self-similarity  
3. Zoom to elephant trunk → feel the chaos boundary  
4. Random jump 5× → journal: “What tiny change in my life today creates infinite difference tomorrow?”  
5. GODSEED integration: Hold a decision in mind while zooming. Let the fractal show you branching paths.

Master this = master unpredictable futures.
